        <h1>All of our soaps and scrubbies contain goat's milk, distilled water, saponified oils of coconut oil, olive oil and lard. They are all hand and home made so sizes may vary slightly.</h1><p></p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            My mom and I started this endeavor of making goat's milk soaps 16 years ago, when I was having problems with eczema on my face. We were surprised to find that goat's milk has been used for many years on the skin, as it has many healing properties in it that are  beneficial for dry skin, eczema, psoriasis and sensitive skin types. It worked for me and soon we were producing more for other people with similar complaints. And so over the past 16 years we have been producing and selling our 30+ varieties at farmer's markets and many a craft show. Customers rave about our soaps. Long lasting bars leave little or no residue, and yet produce beautiful thick luxurious lather. We use only top quality essential oils, and many soaps contain herbs and flowers we grow ourselves. We hope our goat's milk soaps bring a little bit of joy to you each and every day!
