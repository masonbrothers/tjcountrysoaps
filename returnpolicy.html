        <br>
        <br>To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging.
        <br>
        <br>Several types of goods are exempt from being returned. Perishable goods such as food, flowers, newspapers or magazines cannot be returned. We also do not accept products that are intimate or sanitary goods, hazardous materials, or flammable liquids or gases.

        <br>If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.
        <br>
        <br>Late or missing refunds (if applicable)
        <br>If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.
        <br>Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.
        <br>Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.
        <br>If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at teresa@tjsoaps.com.
        <br>
        <br>Sale items (if applicable)
        <br>Only regular priced items may be refunded, unfortunately sale items cannot be refunded.
        <br>
        <br>Exchanges (if applicable)
        <br>We only replace items if they are defective or damaged.  If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us an email at %{email %> and send your item to: RR3 Site 1 Box 11, Lacombe, AB, T4L 2N3, Canada.
        <br>
        <br>Gifts
        <br>If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you’ll receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you.
        <br>
        <br>If the item wasn’t marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the order shipped to themselves to give to you later, we will send a refund to the gift giver and he will find out about your return.
        <br>
        <br>Shipping
        <br>To return your product, you should mail your product to: RR3 Site 1 Box 11, Lacombe, AB, T4L 2N3, Canada.

        <br>
        <br>Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you, may vary.
        <br>
        <br>If you are shipping an item over $75, you should consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We don’t guarantee that we will receive your returned item.
